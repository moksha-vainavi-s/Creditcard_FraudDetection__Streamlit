# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using (machine learning) logistic regression model .  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, and a Streamlit app for prediction.

## 📌 Files
- **MOKSHA_VAINAVI_S_Credit_Card_Fraudlent_Transaction_Dataset.ipynb** – Data cleaning, EDA, model building.
- **Streamlit_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb** – Streamlit UI for predicting fraud.

## 📊 What the project does
- Loads and preprocesses the dataset  
- Trains machine learning models  
- Evaluates performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
- Predicts whether a transaction is **Fraudlent** or **Not Fraudlent**  
- Provides a simple user interface using **Streamlit**
